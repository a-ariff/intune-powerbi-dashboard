## Permissions

### Principle of Least Privilege
- Grant minimum required permissions
- Regular access reviews and audits
- Role-based access control (RBAC)

### Microsoft Graph API Permissions
```
Required Application Permissions:
- Device.Read.All
- DeviceManagementConfiguration.Read.All
- DeviceManagementApps.Read.All
- DeviceManagementManagedDevices.Read.All
- Directory.Read.All
```

### Power BI Service Permissions
- Dashboard viewers: Read-only access
- Report builders: Edit permissions for specific workspaces
- Administrators: Full control with audit trail

## Compliance

### Regulatory Requirements
- **GDPR**: Data protection and privacy
- **HIPAA**: Healthcare information security (if applicable)
- **SOX**: Financial reporting controls
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management

### Data Retention Policies
- Automatic data purging after retention period
- Secure data archival procedures
- Compliance audit trails

## Data Protection

### Encryption
- **Data at Rest**: Power BI native encryption
- **Data in Transit**: TLS 1.2 minimum
- **API Communications**: HTTPS only

### Data Classification
- **Public**: General organizational metrics
- **Internal**: Departmental data
- **Confidential**: PII and sensitive device information
- **Restricted**: Executive dashboards and security metrics

### Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
- Prevent unauthorized data export
- Monitor data access patterns
- Alert on suspicious activities

## Authentication

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Required for all dashboard access
- Conditional access policies
- Risk-based authentication

### Service Principal Security
- Certificate-based authentication preferred
- Regular credential rotation (90 days)
- Secure key storage (Azure Key Vault)

### Session Management
- Automatic timeout after inactivity
- Concurrent session limits
- Secure logout procedures

## Network Security

### Firewall Configuration
- Whitelist Power BI service endpoints
- Restrict outbound connections
- Monitor network traffic

### VPN and Private Endpoints
- Use Azure Private Endpoints when possible
- VPN access for remote dashboard viewing
- Network segmentation for sensitive data

## Monitoring

### Audit Logging
- All dashboard access logged
- Data export activities tracked
- Administrative changes recorded

### Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
- Integration with organizational SIEM
- Real-time security alerts
- Automated incident response

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Failed authentication attempts
- Unusual data access patterns
- Export activities and data downloads
- Administrative changes

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Procedures
1. **Detection**: Identify security threats
2. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
3. **Eradication**: Remove security threats
4. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
5. **Lessons Learned**: Post-incident analysis

### Emergency Contacts
- Security team escalation procedures
- Management notification protocols
- Third-party vendor contacts

## Implementation Checklist

### Initial Setup
- [ ] Configure service principal with minimal permissions
- [ ] Enable MFA for all users
- [ ] Set up audit logging
- [ ] Configure data retention policies
- [ ] Implement network security controls

### Ongoing Maintenance
- [ ] Monthly access reviews
- [ ] Quarterly security assessments
- [ ] Annual penetration testing
- [ ] Regular credential rotation
- [ ] Security awareness training
