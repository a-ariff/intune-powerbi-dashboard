Comprehensive Power BI solution for monitoring Microsoft Intune device compliance, software inventory, and endpoint security

## Docker

This repository includes Docker packaging for easy deployment and distribution of the dashboard.

### Pulling and Running the Image

Pull the latest Docker image from GitHub Container Registry:
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/a-ariff/intune-powerbi-dashboard:latest
```

Run the container:
```bash
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 ghcr.io/a-ariff/intune-powerbi-dashboard:latest
```

### Building from Source

Alternatively, build the image locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/a-ariff/intune-powerbi-dashboard.git
cd intune-powerbi-dashboard
docker build -t intune-powerbi-dashboard .
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 intune-powerbi-dashboard
```

### Customization Note

Note: The included Dockerfile is a minimal template designed to serve dashboard files via a lightweight HTTP server. This is provided as an example and can be modified as needed to:
• Integrate with specific data sources
• Add authentication mechanisms
• Configure custom ports or SSL
• Include additional dependencies
• Run custom processing scripts

See the Dockerfile and .github/workflows/docker-publish.yml for implementation details.

### 🚀 Combined Solution with RustDesk Remote Access

For organizations requiring both device monitoring and secure remote access capabilities, we provide a comprehensive Docker Compose solution that combines the Intune PowerBI dashboard with RustDesk server services.

#### Complete Remote Access & Monitoring Stack

The `docker-compose-full.yml` file provides:
- **Intune Dashboard**: Full monitoring and analytics capabilities
- **RustDesk Server**: Self-hosted remote access solution with signal (hbbs) and relay (hbbr) servers
- **Reverse Proxy**: Unified access through nginx
- **Production Ready**: Health checks, persistent storage, and network isolation

```bash
# Deploy the complete stack
docker-compose -f docker-compose-full.yml up -d

# Access dashboard
http://localhost:8000

# Configure RustDesk clients with:
# Signal server: your-server-ip:21116
# Relay server: your-server-ip:21117
```

#### Benefits of Combined Deployment

- **Unified Infrastructure**: Single deployment for monitoring and remote access
- **Cost Effective**: Self-hosted alternative to commercial remote access solutions
- **Enhanced Security**: Network isolation between services with proper firewall rules
- **Scalability**: Production-ready configuration with health checks and auto-restart
- **Enterprise Ready**: Comprehensive logging, monitoring, and security considerations

This integrated solution is ideal for IT administrators who need both comprehensive device monitoring through Intune analytics and secure remote access capabilities for device management and support.
